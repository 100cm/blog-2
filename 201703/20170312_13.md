## 背景                 
cacheline对齐，可以大幅提升高并发下的性能。  
        
```        
Hackers,  
  
originally this idea was proposed by Andres Freund while experimenting with  
lockfree Pin/UnpinBuffer [1].  
The patch is attached as well as results of pgbench -S on 72-cores  
machine.  As before it shows huge benefit in this case.  
For sure, we should validate that it doesn't cause performance regression  
in other cases.  At least we should test read-write and smaller machines.  
Any other ideas?
