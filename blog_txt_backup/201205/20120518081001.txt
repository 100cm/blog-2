PostgreSQL 9.2 Something must aware when Migrate to it

PostgreSQL 9.2 放出Beta版后，列出了很多新特性，提高了性能等。
但是在迁移到PostgreSQL 9.2 前，请关注在兼容性这块与以往的版本有那些改变。
例如9.0放出的时候, 它把默认的bytea_output=escape改成了bytea_output=hex. 所以使用了bytea类型的应用就必须要注意了.
那么9.2有哪些需要注意的呢?
E.1.2. Migration to Version 9.2

A dump/restore using pg_dump, or use of pg_upgrade, is required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous release.
Version 9.2 contains a number of changes that may affect compatibility with previous releases. Observe the following incompatibilities:

E.1.2.1. Functions

-- Ensure that xpath() escapes special characters in string values (Florian Pflug, Radoslaw Smogura)
Without this it is possible to output illegal XML.

-- Remove hstore's => operator (Robert Haas, David Wheeler)
Users should now use hstore(text, text). Since PostgreSQL 9.0, a warning message is emitted when an operator named => is created because the SQL standard reserves that token for another use.

-- Have pg_relation_size() and friends return NULL if the object does not exist (Phil Sorber)
This prevents queries that call these functions from returning errors during concurrent drop operations.

-- Remove the spclocation field from pg_tablespace (Magnus Hagander, Tom Lane)
This field was duplicative of the symbolic links already present in the data directory. This allows tablespace directories to be moved while the server is down. Also add pg_tablespace_location() to allow querying of the symbolic links.

E.1.2.1.1. Temporal Functions

-- Have EXTRACT of a non-timezone-aware value measure the epoch from local midnight, not UTC midnight (Tom Lane)
Having these computations depend on UTC was inconsistent. The old behavior is available by casting the value to timestamp with time zone.
对于使用了此类场景的应用需要注意.

-- Properly parse time strings with trailing yesterday, today, and tomorrow (Dean Rasheed)
Previously, SELECT '04:00:00 yesterday'::timestamp returned yesterday's date at midnight.

-- Fix to_date() and to_timestamp() to wrap incomplete dates toward 2020 (Bruce Momjian)
Previously, supplied years and year masks of less than four digits wrapped inconsistently.

E.1.2.2. Object Modification

-- Prevent ALTER DOMAIN from working on non-domain types (Peter Eisentraut)
Owner and schema changes were previously possible on non-domain types.

-- No longer auto-lowercase procedural language names (Robert Haas)
While unquoted language identifiers are still lowercased, double and single-quoted identifiers are no longer down-cased.

E.1.2.3. Command-Line Tools

-- Provide consistent backquote, variable expansion, and quoted substring behavior in psql meta-command arguments (Tom Lane)
Previously, such usage was only properly expanded when isolated by whitespace, e.g. 'FOO'BAR was output as FOO BAR.

-- No longer treat clusterdb table names as double-quoted; no longer treat reindexdb table and index names as double-quoted (Bruce Momjian)
Users must supply double-quotes in the command arguments to accomplish double-quoting behavior.

-- Disable prompting for the user name in dropdb unless --interactive is specified (Peter Eisentraut, Josh Kupershmidt)

-- No longer have createuser prompt for settings (Peter Eisentraut, Josh Kupershmidt)
Previously createuser prompted regarding various user settings.

-- Remove initdb support for the crypt authentication method (Peter Eisentraut)
This was removed from the backend years ago.

E.1.2.4. Server Settings

-- Remove the postgresql.conf setting silent_mode (Heikki Linnakangas)
This behavior could already be accomplished with pg_ctl -l postmaster.log.

-- Remove GUC wal_sender_delay, as it is no longer needed (Tom Lane)
The new "latch" capability made this setting unnecessary.
之前在测试9.2级联复制的时候就发现这个参数没了, 原来是被新的latch取代了.

-- Remove the custom_variable_classes postgresql.conf parameter (Tom Lane)
The checking provided by this setting was dubious. Now any setting can be prefixed by any class name.
之前发现过没有配置custom_variable_classes但是有配置了以class_name开头的定制参数时引致DOWN机的情况, 9.2去除了配置custom_variable_classes, 可以随意配置定制化参数了.

-- Add GUC parameters for specifying the locations of server-side SSL files (Peter Eisentraut)
This allows changing the location of the files that were previously hard-coded to server.crt, server.key, root.crt, root.crl. CA (crt) and CRL files no longer have default names, and if specified, these files must exist.

E.1.2.5. Monitoring

-- Rename pg_stat_activity.procpid to pid, to match other system tables (Magnus Hagander)
server process进程号统一叫pid了.

-- Create a separate pg_stat_activity column to report state information, e.g. idle (Scott Mead, Magnus Hagander, Greg Smith)
The last query values are preserved, allowing for enhanced analysis.
pg_stat_activity增加了两列, 一列用于存储当前backend_process的状态, 另一列存储最后一次状态改变的时间.如下
Something must aware when Migrate to PostgreSQL 9.2 - 德哥@Digoal - The Heart,The World.
 
-- Rename pg_stat_activity.current_query to query because it is not cleared when the query completes (Magnus Hagander)
current_query更名为query.

-- Change all SQL-level statistics timing values to float8-stored milliseconds (Tom Lane)
The columns affected are: pg_stat_user_functions.total_time, pg_stat_user_functions.self_time, pg_stat_xact_user_functions.total_time, pg_stat_xact_user_functions.self_time.

-- Change pg_stat_statements' total_time column to be measured in milliseconds (Tom Lane)
以前是秒, 用起来不太方便, 每次算都要乘以1000来转成毫秒.
