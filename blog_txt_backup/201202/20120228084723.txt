在hot standby库查询SQL的时候, 也许你碰到过invalid memory alloc request size的错误, 这可能是因为以下原因造成的 : 

Fix transient zeroing of shared buffers during WAL replay (Tom Lane)

The replay logic would sometimes zero and refill a shared buffer, so that the contents were transiently invalid. In hot standby mode this can result in a query that's executing in parallel seeing garbage data. Various symptoms could result from that, but the most common one seems to be "invalid memory alloc request size".



如今已经修正.
