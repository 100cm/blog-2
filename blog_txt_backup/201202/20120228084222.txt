以前写过几篇关于读取块错误的BLOG,

如今, PostgreSQL 9.1.3, 9.0.7, 8.4.11, 8.3.18 版本修正了这个错误.

如下 : 

Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with vacuuming (Tom Lane)

An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a concurrently-running VACUUM to miss removing index entries that it should remove. After the corresponding table rows are removed, the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as "could not read block N in file ...") or worse, silently wrong query results after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table locations. 
This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs so infrequently that it was not diagnosed until now. If you have reason to suspect that it has happened in your database, reindexing the affected index will fix things.
