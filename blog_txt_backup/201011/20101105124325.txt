[注]摘自《PostgreSQL 9 Administration Cookbook》
If you often update only some table and can arrange so that you don't change any indexed
felds, then setting fillfactor to a lower value than the default of 100 for that a table
enables PostgreSQL to use HOT updates, which can be an order of magnitude faster than
ordinary updates. HOT updates not only avoid creating new index entries but also can perform
a fast mini-vacuum inside the page to make room for new rows.
ALTER TABLE t1 SET (fillfactor = 70);
Tells PostgreSQL to fll only 70% of each page in table t1 when doing inserts, so that 30% is
left for use by in-page (HOT) updates.
