CLOCKDIFF(8)           System Manager’s Manual: iputils           CLOCKDIFF(8)

NAME
       clockdiff - measure clock difference between hosts

SYNOPSIS
       clockdiff [ -o]  [ -o1]  destination

DESCRIPTION
       clockdiff  Measures clock difference between us and destination with 1 msec resolution using ICMP TIMESTAMP [2]
       packets or, optionally, IP TIMESTAMP option [3] option added to ICMP ECHO.  [1]

OPTIONS
       -o     Use IP TIMESTAMP with ICMP ECHO instead of ICMP TIMESTAMP messages. It is useful with some destinations,
              which do not support ICMP TIMESTAMP (f.e. Solaris <2.4).

       -o1    Slightly  different  form  of -o, namely it uses three-term IP TIMESTAMP with prespecified hop addresses
              instead of four term one.  What flavor works better depends on target host. Particularly, -o  is  better
              for Linux.

WARNINGS
       · Some nodes (Cisco) use non-standard timestamps, which is allowed by RFC, but makes timestamps mostly useless.

       · Some nodes generate messed timestamps (Solaris>2.4), when run xntpd. Seems, its IP  stack  uses  a  corrupted
         clock  source,  which  is synchronized to time-of-day clock periodically and jumps randomly making timestamps
         mostly useless. Good news is that you can use NTP in this case, which is even better.

       · clockdiff shows difference in time modulo 24 days.

AUTHOR
       clockdiff was compiled by Alexey Kuznetsov <kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>. It was based on code borrowed from BSD timed
       daemon.

SECURITY
       clockdiff requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to be executed. It is safe to be used as set-uid root.

AVAILABILITY
       clockdiff  is  part  of iputils package and the latest versions are  available in source form for anonymous ftp
       ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iputils-current.tar.gz.
