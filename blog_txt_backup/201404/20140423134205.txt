Overview

Bingo is a RDBMS data cartridge that provides the industry’s next-generation, fast, scalable, and efficient storage and searching solution for chemical information.

Bingo seamlessly integrates the chemistry into Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases. Its extensible indexing is designed to enable scientists to store, index, and search chemical moieties alongside numbers and text within one underlying relational database server.

Bingo sets the industry standard in structure and reaction registration and retrieval. You can register entities reliably with the confidence that you can retrieve them rapidly.

Because Bingo implements state-of-the-art indexing algorithms within the underlying database server, chemical searching is fast and reliable. Users can seamlessly combine chemical substructure, reaction, and exact structure searching with numeric and text SQL terms.
