[PG News] Separating bgwriter and checkpointer

2011-09-22 10:50:43   查看原文>>

几个看点 :

1. splits bgwriter into 2 processes: checkpointer and bgwriter.
2. replace polling loops with latches for power reduction.
3.  could there be any benefit to spawning a separate bgwriter process for each tablespace.

Currently the bgwriter process performs both background writing, checkpointing and some other duties. 

This means that we can't perform the final checkpoint fsync without stopping background writing, so there is a negative performance effect from doing both things in one process.  

Additionally, our aim in 9.2 is to replace polling loops with latches for power reduction. 

The complexity of the bgwriter loops is high and it seems unlikely to come up with a clean approach using latches.  

This patch splits bgwriter into 2 processes: checkpointer and bgwriter, seeking to avoid contentious changes. 

Additional changes are expected in this release to build upon these changes for both new processes, though this patch stands on its own as both a performance vehicle and in some ways a refcatoring to simplify the code.  

Checkpointer does the important things, "new bgwriter" just does background writing and so is much less important than before. 

Current patch has a bug at shutdown I've not located yet, but seems likely is a simple error. 

That is mainly because for personal reasons I've not been able to work on the patch recently. 

I expect to be able to fix that later in the CF.

/*********************************************************************/

While you're already splitting up bgwriter, could there be any benefit to spawning a separate bgwriter process for each tablespace?  

If your database has one tablespace on a fast I/O system and another on a slow one, the slow tablespace would also bog down background writing for the fast tablespace. 

But I don't know whether that's really a problem or not.
