The core functionality is provided by a series of built-in modules, listed below. Additional functionality or changes in application behaviour can be achieved by installing add-ons. See the next section for more on add-ons.

Add-ons

Some functionality isn't suitable for inclusion in the standard application. For example because it's not mature enough or because its setup is too specialized. Users can then individually decide whether they need the functionality and install it when required. Below you find a shortlist of add-ons available for
LedgerSMB 1.3(link is external).

  • Import Transactions
    Import transactions from external CSV files. Currently single GL and batches of AP files are supported but could be extended to support other financial transactions easily.
  • Template Transactions
    Create template transactions (AR, AP, and GL) that can be used as the basis for actual financial transactions on a flexible schedule.
  • Budgetting
    Track budgets by project and/or department, and run variance reports
