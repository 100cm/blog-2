R - vector+vector warning longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)

Vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions, in which case the operations are performed element by element. Vectors occurring in the same expression need not all be of the same length. If they are not, the value of the expression is a vector with the same length as the longest vector which occurs in the expression.
Shorter vectors in the expression are recycled as often as need be (perhaps fractionally) until they match the length of the longest vector. In particular a constant is simply repeated. So with the above assignments the command

> v <- 2*x + y + 1
generates a new vector v of length 11 constructed by adding together, element by element, 2*x repeated 2.2 times, y repeated just once, and 1 repeated 11 times.

当计算中的多个vector的元素个数不一致时, 如果vector的元素不成倍数, 会有个告警.

小的vector在运算时, 是重复计算的. 
例如 : 
1,2
+
3,4,5,6,7
=
3+1, 4+2, 5+1, 6+2, 7+1

例如 : 
> x <- c(1,2,3,4)
> assign("y",x/2)
> z <- c(x,y,1)
> x
[1] 1 2 3 4
> y
[1] 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0
> z
[1] 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 1.0
> x+y
[1] 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0

以下操作会通过, 但是有个告警. 
> x+y+z
[1]  2.5  5.0  7.5 10.0  2.0  4.0  6.0  8.0  2.5
Warning message:
In x + y + z :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

> x+y+z+1
[1]  3.5  6.0  8.5 11.0  3.0  5.0  7.0  9.0  3.5
Warning message:
In x + y + z :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
