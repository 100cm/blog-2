The sar utility is called by cron every 10 minutes to put a snapshot of system activity in the /var/log/saDD file (where “DD” is the two-digit day of the month). To change this value, edit the /etc/cron.d/sysstat file. The file is in standard cron format. The default file is below:

# run system activity accounting tool every 10 minutes

*/10 * * * * root /usr/lib/sa/sa1 1 1 # generate a daily summary of process accounting at 23:53 53 23 * * * root /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -A 

Change the “10″ in the second line from the top to the number of minutes desired.

It is not recommended to attempt to collect sar data more than once per minute, as sar is not guaranteed to keep a finer resolution.
