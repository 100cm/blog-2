PostgreSQL 9.1 Replication role privilege change to REPLICATION from SUPERUSER

PostgreSQL 9.0引入了stream replication的概念，使用stream replication需要在primary 新建一个用于replication的用户。
这个用户需要superuser权限
以下是9.0.4的文档引用:
It is very important that the access privileges for replication be set up so that only trusted users can read the WAL stream, because it is easy to extract privileged information from it. Standby servers must authenticate to the primary as a superuser account. So a role with the SUPERUSER and LOGIN privileges needs to
be created on the primary.

由于存在一些安全隐患，而且确实不需要superuser这么大的权限来满足replication的需求。
因此在9.1以后，新增了一个权限角色replication.9.1beta1 原文引用:

It is very important that the access privileges for replication be set up so that only trusted users can read the WAL stream, because it is easy to extract privileged information from it. Standby servers must authenticate to the primary as an account that has the REPLICATION privilege. So a role with
the REPLICATION and LOGIN privileges needs to be created on the primary.

    Note: It is recommended that a dedicated user account is used for replication. While the REPLICATION privilege is granted to superuser accounts by default, it is not recommended to use superuser accounts for replication. While REPLICATION privilege gives very high permissions, it does not allow the user to modify
    any data on the primary system, which the SUPERUSER privilege does.
