Commemorate PostgreSQL's plain-text HISTORY file

PostgreSQL 代码中不再产生HISTORY的文本文件, 而是以指示信息代替之. 
TOM可能考虑到这是一个重复的工作, 不过我经常从这个文件grep一些有用的信息, 以后没了还真是有些惋惜.
毕竟从src/doc/sgml/html的分开的release文件中搜索总是没有HISTORY中方便.

Don't generate plain-text HISTORY and src/test/regress/README anymore.

Providing this information as plain text was doubtless worth the trouble
ten years ago, but it seems likely that hardly anyone reads it in this
format anymore.  And the effort required to maintain these files (in the
form of extra-complex markup rules in the relevant parts of the SGML
documentation) is significant.  So, let's stop doing that and rely solely
on the other documentation formats.

Per discussion, the plain-text INSTALL instructions might still be worth
their keep, so we continue to generate that file.

Rather than remove HISTORY and src/test/regress/README from distribution
tarballs entirely, replace them with simple stub files that tell the reader
where to find the relevant documentation.  This is mainly to avoid possibly
breaking packaging recipes that expect these files to exist.

Back-patch to all supported branches, because simplifying the markup
requirements for release notes won't help much unless we do it in all
branches.
