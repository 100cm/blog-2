pgpool-II internal process - 德哥@Digoal - PostgreSQL research

客户端连接pgpool的流程如下 : 

Why max_connection must satisfy this formula max_connection >= (num_init_children * max_pool) and not max_connection >= num_init_children?

    Probably you need to understand how pgpool uses these variables. Here is internal processing inside pgpool.

 1. Wait for connection request from clients.
 2. pgpool child receives connection request from a client.
 3. The pgpool child looks for existing connection in the pool which has requested database/user pair up to max_pool.
 4. If found, reuse it.
 5. If not found, opens a new connection to PostgreSQL and registers to the pool. If the pool has no empty slot, closes the oldest connection to PostgreSQL and reuse the slot.
 6. Do some query processing until the client sends session close request.
 7. Close the connection to client but keeps the connection to PostgreSQL for future use.
 8. Go to #1

pool的重用规则如下(注意child进程之间不共享连接) : 

Is connection pool cache shared among pgpool process?

    No, the connection pool cache is in pgpool's process private memory and is not shared by other pgpool. This is how the connection cache is managed: Suppose pgpool process 12345 has connection cache for database A/user B but process 12346 does not have connection cache for database A/user B and both 12345 and 12346
    are in idle state(no client is connecting at this point). If client connects to pgpool process 12345 with database A/user B, then the exisiting connection of 12345 is reused. On the other hand, If client connects to pgpool process 12346, 12346 needs to create new connection. Whether 12345 or 12346 is chosen, is
    not under control of pgpool. However in the long run, each pgpool child process will be equally chosen and it is expected that each process's pool will be resued equally.
