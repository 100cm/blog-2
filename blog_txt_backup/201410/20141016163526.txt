查询表的某个或某些字段批量匹配, 可以有几种写法.

select * from t2 where id in (1,2,3,100,1000,0);
select * from t2 where id = ANY ('{1,2,3,100,1000,0}'::integer[]);
select * from t2 where id = ANY (VALUES (1),(2),(3),(100),(1000),(0));
select t2.* from t2 join (VALUES (1),(2),(3),(100),(1000),(0)) as t(id) on t2.id=t.id;
还有or的写法.  select * from t2 where id=1 or id=2 or id=3 ....;


这里主要看一下前几种.

执行计划 : 

digoal=# explain select * from t2 where id in (1,2,3,100,1000,0);
                             QUERY PLAN                             
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using t2_pkey on t2  (cost=0.29..25.82 rows=6 width=37)
   Index Cond: (id = ANY ('{1,2,3,100,1000,0}'::integer[]))
(2 rows)
digoal=# explain select * from t2 where id = ANY ('{1,2,3,100,1000,0}'::integer[]);
                             QUERY PLAN                             
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using t2_pkey on t2  (cost=0.29..25.82 rows=6 width=37)
   Index Cond: (id = ANY ('{1,2,3,100,1000,0}'::integer[]))
(2 rows)


=any (values)会产生hash 聚合

digoal=# explain select * from t2 where id = ANY (VALUES (1),(2),(3),(100),(1000),(0));
                               QUERY PLAN                                
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.38..46.04 rows=6 width=37)
   ->  HashAggregate  (cost=0.09..0.15 rows=6 width=4)
         ->  Values Scan on "*VALUES*"  (cost=0.00..0.08 rows=6 width=4)
   ->  Index Scan using t2_pkey on t2  (cost=0.29..7.64 rows=1 width=37)
         Index Cond: (id = "*VALUES*".column1)
(5 rows)


而使用join不会产生hash 聚合.

digoal=# explain select t2.* from t2 join (VALUES (1),(2),(3),(100),(1000),(0)) as t(id) on t2.id=t.id;
                               QUERY PLAN                                
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.29..45.96 rows=6 width=37)
   ->  Values Scan on "*VALUES*"  (cost=0.00..0.08 rows=6 width=4)
   ->  Index Scan using t2_pkey on t2  (cost=0.29..7.64 rows=1 width=37)
         Index Cond: (id = "*VALUES*".column1)
(4 rows)


用VALUES时, 会带入一个Values Scan节点, 和seq scan, index scan等scan一样, 都属于数据扫描节点.

执行结果是一致的, 

digoal=# select * from t2 where id in (1,2,3,100,1000,0);
  id  |               info               
------+----------------------------------
    1 | 07d16508c6719888fe7030354f9eb3ed
    2 | a190af0a3e0f62c1c210e314e2b23018
    3 | 2ecbd5b8d321bb409d14992f234527bb

 1000 | 5964d4dba996b76360544ef6aa90ed0e
(5 rows)
digoal=# select * from t2 where id = ANY ('{1,2,3,100,1000,0}'::integer[]);
  id  |               info               
------+----------------------------------
    1 | 07d16508c6719888fe7030354f9eb3ed
    2 | a190af0a3e0f62c1c210e314e2b23018
    3 | 2ecbd5b8d321bb409d14992f234527bb

 1000 | 5964d4dba996b76360544ef6aa90ed0e
(5 rows)


这个结果反了, 可能是hash 聚合造成的.

digoal=# select * from t2 where id = ANY (VALUES (1),(2),(3),(100),(1000),(0));
  id  |               info

有一位外国网友在他的SQL使用场景中, 使用values节点来改变执行计划, 获得更好的效率. 

A simple but non-obvious one-line change (ANY(ARRAY[...]) to ANY(VALUES(...))) in a (bad) PostgreSQL query cuts query time from 20s to 0.2s. Starting with low-level metrics we make our way to your best friend: EXPLAIN ANALYZE. The amount of time invested will pay off a hundred times over. The Postgres community is
your second best friend.

Monitoring slow Postgres queries with Postgres

Earlier this week the performance of one of our (many) databases was plagued by a few pathologically large, primary-key queries in a smallish table (10 GB, 15 million rows) used to feed our graph editor.

In 99.9% of accounts these queries would be zippy. In a few cases where the number of tags used to annotate metrics is large, these queries would take up to 20 seconds. That much time spent in a database meant that someone was waiting in front of their browser for the graph editor to respond. This is obviously not the
best experience for the unlucky 0.1%.

Here is the surprisingly simple culprit:

            SELECT c.key,
                   c.x_key,
                   c.tags,
                   x.name
             FROM context c
12345678910  JOIN x
               ON c.x_key = x.key
            WHERE c.key = ANY (ARRAY[15368196, -- 11,000 other keys --)])
              AND c.x_key = 1
              AND c.tags @> ARRAY[E'blah'];

Table X contains a few thousand rows, Table C contains 15 millions rows. Both “key” columns are primary keys with proper indexing. Pretty straightforward, it’s a simple primary key lookup. Where things get interesting is when you increase the number of keys. At 11,000 keys we get the following plan, by
prefixing EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) to the query:

                            Nested Loop  (cost=6923.33..11770.59 rows=1 width=362) (actual time=17128.188..22109.283 rows=10858 loops=1)

As you can see at the bottom of the plan, the query took 22 seconds to execute. These 22 seconds can be visualized on the following graph as pure CPU execution split 90/10 between Postgres and the OS; very little disk I/O.

At the lowest level these queries would look like these spikes of CPU utilization. CPU graphs are seldom useful but in this case it confirmed a crucial point: the database was not waiting for the disks to read data. It was doing things like sorting, hashing and comparing rows.

The second interesting metric that tracks the spikes very closely is the number of rows that are “fetched” by Postgres (in this case not returned, just looked at and discarded).

Clearly something is regularly and methodically going through a lot of rows: our query.

The Postgres Performance Problem: Bitmap Heap Scan

The rows_fetched metric is consistent with the following part of the plan:

      Buffers: shared hit=83494
        ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on context c  (cost=6923.33..11762.31 rows=1 width=329) (actual time=17128.121..22031.783 rows=10858 loops=1)
12345         Recheck Cond: ((tags @> '{blah}'::text[]) AND (x_key = 1))
              Filter: (key = ANY ('{15368196,(a lot more keys here)}'::integer[]))
              Buffers: shared hit=50919

Postgres is reading Table C using a Bitmap Heap Scan. When the number of keys to check stays small, it can efficiently use the index to build the bitmap in memory. If the bitmap gets too large, the query optimizer changes the way it looks up data. In our case it has a large number of keys to check so it uses the more
approximative way to retrieve the candidate rows and checks each row individually for a match on x_key and tags. All this “loading in memory” and “checking individual row” takes time (the Recheck Cond in the plan).

Luckily for us the table is 30% loaded in RAM so it is not as bad as retrieving the rows from disk. It still has a very noticeable impact on performance. Remember that the query is quite simple. It’s a primary key lookup so there aren’t many obvious ways to fix it without dramatically re-architecting the database or
the application. We turned to the community for help via the PGSQL-Performance mailing list.

The solution

This is yet another reason why we love open-source and its culture of helping users.Tom Lane, one of the most prolific open-source authors around, suggested to try this instead:

            SELECT c.key,
                   c.x_key,
                   c.tags,
                   x.name
             FROM context c
12345678910  JOIN x
               ON c.x_key = x.key
            WHERE c.key = ANY (VALUES (15368196), -- 11,000 other keys --)
              AND c.x_key = 1
              AND c.tags @> ARRAY[E'blah'];

Can you spot the difference? ARRAY has been changed to VALUES.

The query optimizer is fooled by the use of ARRAY[...] to list all the primary keys to look up. VALUES (...), (...) lets the optimizer make full use of the primary key index instead. It is literally a one-line change, which makes no semantic difference.

Here is the plan of the new query. The 2 major differences are on lines 3 and 14.

                    Nested Loop  (cost=168.22..2116.29 rows=148 width=362) (actual time=22.134..256.531 rows=10858 loops=1)
                      Buffers: shared hit=44967
                      ->  Index Scan using x_pkey on x  (cost=0.00..8.27 rows=1 width=37) (actual time=0.071..0.073 rows=1 loops=1)
                            Index Cond: (id = 1)
                            Buffers: shared hit=4
                      ->  Nested Loop  (cost=168.22..2106.54 rows=148 width=329) (actual time=22.060..242.406 rows=10858 loops=1)

                                  ->  Values Scan on "*VALUES*"  (cost=0.00..140.19 rows=11215 width=4) (actual time=0.005..9.527 rows=11215 loops=1)

                                  Buffers: shared hit=44963
                    Total runtime: 263.639 ms

From 22,000ms to 200ms. That’s a 100x speedup for a simple one-line change.
