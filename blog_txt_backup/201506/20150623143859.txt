2014年PG大会的一个议题，教你使用python写FDW，大大提高了开发FDW的效率。
http://www.pgcon.org/2014/schedule/events/655.en.html
Multicorn is a generic Foreign Data Wrapper which goal is to simplify development of FDWs by writing them in Python.

We will see:

what is an FDW
what Multicorn is trying to solve
how to use it, with a brief tour of the FDWs shipping with Multicorn.
how to write your own FDW in python, including the new 9.3 write API
the internals: what Multicorn is doing for you behind the scenes, and what it doesn't
After a presentation of FDWs in general, and what the Multicorn extension really is, we will take a look at some of the FDWs bundled with Multicorn.

Then, a complete tour of the Multicorn API will teach you how to write a FDW in python, including the following features:

using the table definition
WHERE clauses push-down
output columns restrictions
influencing the planner
writing to a foreign table
transaction management
This will be a hands-on explanation, with code snippets allowing you to build your own FDW in python from scratch.
