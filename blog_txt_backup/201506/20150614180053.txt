PostgreSQL 9.5 新增的恢复控制recovery.conf 参数 recovery_target_action 。

recovery_target_action (enum)
Specifies what action the server should take once the recovery target is reached. The default is pause, which means recovery will be paused. promote means the recovery process will finish and the server will start to accept connections. Finally shutdown will stop the server after reaching the recovery target.

The intended use of the pause setting is to allow queries to be executed against the database to check if this recovery target is the most desirable point for recovery. The paused state can be resumed by using pg_xlog_replay_resume() (see Table 9-70), which then causes recovery to end. If this recovery target is not the desired stopping point, then shut down the server, change the recovery target settings to a later target and restart to continue recovery.

The shutdown setting is useful to have the instance ready at the exact replay point desired. The instance will still be able to replay more WAL records (and in fact will have to replay WAL records since the last checkpoint next time it is started).

Note that because recovery.conf will not be renamed when recovery_target_action is set to shutdown, any subsequent start will end with immediate shutdown unless the configuration is changed or the recovery.conf file is removed manually.

This setting has no effect if no recovery target is set. If hot_standby is not enabled, a setting of pause will act the same as shutdown.



可选值：
pause，需打开hot_standby ，否则和shutdown效果一样。如果打开了hot_standby，那么pause表示暂停恢复，用户此时可以检查是否恢复到了目标点位，如果恢复到了，用户可以使用pg_xlog_replay_resume()暂停恢复，并自动激活数据库同时修改recovery.conf to recovery.done。如果没有恢复到目标点位，那么用户可以关闭数据库，同时修改recovery
target，继续恢复。
shutdown，恢复到目标点后，直接关闭数据库。但是不修改recovery.conf文件名。
promote，自动激活。
