		<div class="blogcnt" style="width:800px;">[转]<br>The <i>Virtual File System</i> (VFS) layer provides
a uniform interface for the kernel to deal with various I/O requests
and specifies a standard interface that each file system must support.
Through this layer, one kernel can mount several different types of
file systems (<i>e.g.</i> <i>EXT2FS</i>, <i>ISO9660FS</i>, <i>NFS</i>,
...) into the same tree structure.  We worked with version 2.2.12
of the Linux kernel and confined our changes to the VFS layer.  By
doing all of our changes in the VFS layer we kept our predictive
prefetching totally independent of the underlying file system.<br>Arguably, the most important service the VFS layer provides is a
uniform I/O data cache.  Linux maintains four caches of I/O data: <i>  page cache</i>, <i>i-node cache</i>, <i>buffer cache</i> and <i>  directory cache</i>.  Figure 1 shows these caches and
how they interact with the kernel, each other and user level programs.
The <i>page cache</i> combines virtual memory and file data.  The <i>  i-node cache</i> keeps recently accessed file i-nodes. The <i>buffer
  cache</i> interfaces with block devices, and caches recently used
meta-data disk blocks.  The Linux kernel reads file data through the
buffer cache, but keeps the data in the page cache for reuse on future
reads. The <i>directory cache</i> (d-cache) keeps in memory a tree that
represents a portion of the file system's directory structure.  This
tree maps a file's path name to an i-node structure and speeds up file
path name look up.  The basic element of the d-cache is a structure
called the <i>d-entry</i>.<br>We implemented our methods of modeling file access patterns by adding
one field to the <i>d-entry</i> structure. The various models would
attach their modeling data structure to this pointer. For the last
successor model this consisted of just a device and inode number.  For
the partitioned models this was a pointer to the partition that began
with the file that the <i>d-entry</i> identified.  After each file
access the model would update its predictions.  The prefetch engine
was then called and would use these predictions to prefetch file data.<br><br><div><img title="The Linux Kernels VFS Layer - 德哥@Digoal - The Heart,The World." alt="The Linux Kernels VFS Layer - 德哥@Digoal - The Heart,The World." style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0pt;" src="http://img308.ph.126.net/K7b0viPRevLGDJyfx2QBIQ==/3908561526604688757.gif"></div>&nbsp;<br>Figure 1</div>
