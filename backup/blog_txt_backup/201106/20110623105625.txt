PostgreSQL will migrate pgfoundry to External Projects

今天准备开一个pgfoundry的project,结果被拒绝了。原因如下:
Your project registration for PgFoundry has been denied.

Project Full Name:  PostgreSQL wal archive in the cloud
Project Unix Name:  walcenter

Reasons for negative decision:

pgFoundry is going to be shut down permanently.  We're no longer accepting new projects.  Please see this page http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Project_Hosting for other hosting options.

猜测PostgreSQL准备全面启用 EXTENSION 了.
