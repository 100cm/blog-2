DragonFlyBSD & hammer fs & swapcache

DragonFlyBSD目前的最新版本为3.5.0
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git

The following graph charts the performance of the PostgreSQL 9.3 development version as of late June 2012 on DragonFly BSD 3.0 and 3.2, FreeBSD 9.1, NetBSD 6.0 and Scientific Linux 6.2 running Linux kernel version 2.6.32. The tests were performed using system defaults on each platform with pgbench as the test client
with a scaling factor of 800. The test system in question was a dual-socket Intel Xeon X5650 with 24GB RAM.
[备注] sclinux 6.2 与 CentOS 6.2 , RHEL 6.2 , Oracle Linux 6.2 等产品雷同.

Features[edit source | editbeta]

HAMMER file systems provide the following features:^[5]^[6]

  • configurable fine-grained and coarse-grained filesystem histories
  • history and snapshots are accessible online
  • near real-time log-less streaming mirroring to slaves or backups
  • different retention parameters for slaves
  • CRC checksumming of data and metadata
  • no fsck required on remount
  • 1 EiB maximum storage capacity
  • online layout correction
  • data deduplication, 一致数据去重的压缩技术

Limitations[edit source | editbeta]

Requires a pruning/reblocking cron job run a few minutes every night to incrementally clean up and regain space on the filesystem. Deletions do not immediately reclaim space.

Does not yet support multi-master configuration.


swapcache

SWAPCACHE - Managed SSD support

This DragonFly feature allows SSD-configured swap to also be used to cache clean filesystem data and meta-data. The feature is carefully managed to maximize the write endurance of the SSD. Swapcache is typically used to reduce or remove seek overheads related to managing filesystems with a large number of discrete
inodes. DragonFly's swap subsystem also supports much larger than normal swap partitions. 32-bit systems support 32G of swap by default while 64-bit systems support up to 512G of swap by default.
