A case : performance slower down when collections upto 8K

以前从一位开发人员那里了解到，mongoDB建了8000多个collection后，速度会变得很慢。
可能和这个有关:

Limits

By default MongoDB has a limit of approximately 24,000 namespaces per database. Each namespace is 628 bytes, the .ns file is 16MB by default.

Each collection counts as a namespace, as does each index.  Thus if every collection had one index, we can create up to 12,000 collections.  The --nssize parameter allows you to increase this limit (see below).

Be aware that there is a certain minimum overhead per collection -- a few KB.  Further, any index will require at least 8KB of data space as the b-tree page size is 8KB. Certain operations can get slow if there are a lot of collections and the meta data gets paged out.

--nssize

If more collections are required, run mongod with the --nssize parameter specified.  This will make the <database>.ns file larger and support more collections.  Note that --nssize sets the size used for newly created .ns files -- if you have an existing database and wish to resize, after running the db with --nssize,
run the db.repairDatabase() command from the shell to adjust the size.

Maximum .ns file size is 2GB.
