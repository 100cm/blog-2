PostgreSQL BIG EVENT. Improve scalability of WAL insertions.

Improve scalability of WAL insertions.

This patch replaces WALInsertLock with a number of WAL insertion slots,
allowing multiple backends to insert WAL records to the WAL buffers
concurrently. This is particularly useful for parallel loading large amounts
of data on a system with many CPUs.

This has one user-visible change: switching to a new WAL segment with
pg_switch_xlog() now fills the remaining unused portion of the segment with
zeros. This potentially adds some overhead, but it has been a very common
practice by DBA's to clear the "tail" of the segment with an external
pg_clearxlogtail utility anyway, to make the WAL files compress better.
With this patch, it's no longer necessary to do that.

This patch adds a new GUC, xloginsert_slots, to tune the number of WAL
insertion slots. Performance testing suggests that the default, 8, works
pretty well for all kinds of worklods, but I left the GUC in place to allow
others with different hardware to test that easily. We might want to remove
that before release.

1. 使用insert slot替代WALInsertLock, 对于当下流行的多核CPU来说是个非常的利好消息, 在多核下可以发挥更好的并行的大量数据导入(写入)性能.
2. 不需要使用pg_clearxlogtail来压缩pg_switch_xlog()产生的带有空白块的xlog文件了. 
3. 目前的slots为8, 可以通过GUC来更改这个slots数. 对于更多核的系统可以适当调大它, 否则使用默认就可以了.
