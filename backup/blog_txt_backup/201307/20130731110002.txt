Greenplum数据库从今年4月份开始, 变更一个PaaS型公司Pivotal的重要组成部分. 
不管什么原因, 这对Greenplum的发展应该会是个利好消息. 

On April 24, 2013, Greenplum became part of a new company: Pivotal
On April 24, 2013, Greenplum became part of Pivotal—the newest member of the EMC federation of companies. Pivotal, at the center of the data, application, and cloud convergence, is a leading provider of application and data infrastructure software, agile development services, and data science consulting.

The company’s mission is to help customers build, deploy, scale, and analyze at an unprecedented velocity as they solve some of the world’s most challenging problems, pursue the greatest opportunities, and serve their customers in the context of who they are, where they are, and what they need in the moment.

Greenplum products play a strategic role in Pivotal’s future as both a set of powerful stand alone products, for data infrastructure modernization, and as key components of the new application and data-centric platform called Pivotal One, the industry’s next-generation Enterprise PaaS.

Thank you for your support of Greenplum and our ground-breaking data products over the years. We look forward to continuing our relationship with you at Pivotal.


Greenplum 4+版本开始更名为社区版, 功能没有限制, 但是受到使用许可的限制.
