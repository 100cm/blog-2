dotCloud是cloudControl提供的一个商业PaaS产品. 

About the dotCloud Platform

The dotCloud Platform is a service provided by cloudControl, Inc. The Platform launched in 2011 as the industry’s first multi-language Platform as a Service. The Platform simplifies application development by allowing programmers to focus just on the code for their service while the Platform handles code building,
scaling, deployment and load-balancing.

In 2013, recognizing the need for flexible, PaaS-like environments inside enterprises and across clouds, the company released much of its PaaS container technology as the open source Docker project. Docker is an open source engine for deploying any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that
will run virtually anywhere. By delivering on the promise “Build Once…Run Anywhere,” Docker has seen explosive growth, and its impact is being seen across devops, PaaS, and hybrid cloud environments.

The success of the Docker project led the company to change its name from "dotCloud, Inc." to "Docker, Inc." in October 2013 in order to reflect its focus on the new product. Docker, Inc. continues to run the dotCloud Platform, supporting thousands of containers running applications for a wide variety of businesses.

dotCloud (now Docker, Inc.) was founded by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl, and is venture backed by Benchmark (Peter Fenton), Trinity Ventures (Dan Scholnick), Yahoo! Founder Jerry Yang, Y Combinator, and Ron Conway. For more information, please see Docker.com

On August 1, 2014 cloudControl, Inc. acquired the dotCloud PaaS business from Docker, Inc.


他们的核心竞争力如其CEO所述 : 
http://blog.dotcloud.com/new-sandbox
Our core competency is and will continue to be the operation and support of large-scale cloud services, for tens of millions of visitors, 24 hours a day, every day. We intend to continue expanding that business, and we believe the best way to do that is by embracing open-source.

dotCloud的开源项 : 

So far dotCloud’s open-source toolbox includes:

  • ZeroRPC, a communication layer for distributed services;
  • Hipache, a routing layer for HTTP and Websockets traffic;
  • Stack.io, a communication framework for real-time web applications
  • Docker, a runtime for linux containers.
  • Recipes for automatically deploying NodeJS, Django, Memcache and dozens of other software components as cloud services.

All these components are already available, and the open-source community is using them to build alternative implementations of dotCloud’s development sandbox. We want to make that even easier by open-sourcing the remaining proprietary components – including our uploader, build system, database components,
application server configuration, and more.

To learn more about future open-source announcements, follow the Docker repository and join the Docker mailing list.

另外, 目前docCloud平台对PG数据库还没有实施HA, 如果你在使用dotCloud的产品的话, 并且需要依赖数据库的HA, 那么现在最好使用mysql+mongodb来代替pg+postgis.

Warning

This service does not scale for High Availability on the dotCloud Platform. Please do not use this service if your application requires High Availability.

Can your application continue to run without this service? If not, then you should choose an alternative, or spend more time planning how your application will handle outages in this service during machine reboots or other interruptions to this service.
