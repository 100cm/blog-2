Other Features
There are a number of features in gweb that are turned off by default or can be adjusted:
1. Metric groups initially collapsed
By default, when you click on a host view, all of the metric groups are expanded.
You can change this view so that only metric graph titles are shown and you have
to click on the metric group to expand the view. To make this collapsed view the
default behavior, add the following setting to conf.php:
$conf['metric_groups_initially_collapsed'] = true;     # 设置默认自动收缩 

2. Filter hosts in cluster view
If you’d like to display only certain hosts in the cluster view, it is possible to filter
them out using the text box that is located next to the “Show Node” dropdown.
The filter accepts regular expressions, so it is possible to show any host that has
“web”  in  its  name  by  entering  web in  the  filter  box;  to  show  only  webservers
web10?web17,  type  web1[0-7];  or,  to  show  web03  and  web04  and  all  MySQL
servers, type  (web0[34]|mysql). Note that the aggregate graphs will still include
data from all hosts, including those not displayed due to filters.

3. Default refresh period
The host and cluster view will refresh every 5 minutes (300 seconds). To adjust it,
set the following value in conf.php:
$conf['default_refresh'] = 300;  # 设置页面刷新时间

4. Strip domain name from hostname in graphs
By default, the gweb interface will display fully qualified domain names (FQDN)
in graphs. If all your machines are on the same domain, you can strip the domain
name by setting the strip_domainnameoption in conf.php:
$conf['strip_domainname'] = true;      # 设置graphs配的主机名, 不显示域名

5. Set default time period
You can adjust the default time period shown by adjusting the following variable:
$conf['default_time_range'] = 'hour';    # 设置默认的时间范围.
