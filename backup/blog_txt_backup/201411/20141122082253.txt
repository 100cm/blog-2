早上起床的时候看朋友圈, 看到少聪分享的一个suse storage的链接(基于ceph改的), 非常棒.

ceph是一个很好的开源分布式存储, 光看介绍已经很兴奋了.
先记录一下, 好好研究.

Ceph is a distributed object store and file system designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability.

OBJECT STORAGE
Ceph provides seamless access to objects using native language bindings or radosgw, a REST interface that’s compatible with applications written for S3 and Swift.

BLOCK STORAGE
Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block device images that are striped and replicated across the entire storage cluster.

FILE SYSTEM
Ceph provides a POSIX-compliant network file system that aims for high performance, large data storage, and maximum compatibility with legacy applications.


WELCOME TO CEPH 

Ceph uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system.
