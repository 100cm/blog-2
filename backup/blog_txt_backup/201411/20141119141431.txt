Bitnami Applications for PostgreSQL

The Bitnami Library greatly simplifies the development and deployment of popular web applications and language runtimes. Each Bitnami app includes all the dependencies it needs to run, including PostgreSQL for those apps and runtimes that require it. The apps are completely free and can be deployed as all-in-one free
native installers, virtual machines and Cloud Images.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views,
triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages).
