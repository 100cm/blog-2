PostgreSQL v9's application_name parameter

2011-01-04 16:18:36   查看原文>>

    The application_name can be any string of less than NAMEDATALEN characters (64 characters in a standard build). It is typically set by an application upon connection to the server. The name will be displayed in the pg_stat_activity view and included in CSV log entries. It can also be included in regular log
entries via the log_line_prefix parameter. Only printable ASCII characters may be used in the application_name value. Other characters will be replaced with question marks (?).
   使用场景如:
    standby配置在recovery.conf参数primary_conninfo中
