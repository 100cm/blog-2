Remove parallel query

    Parallel query has severe restrictions such as certain queries cannot be used, nor in extended protocol (i.e. JDBC).
    Also it is pain to upgrade to newer version of PostgreSQL's SQL parser (yes, pgpool-II uses PostgreSQL's parser code). In short, parallel query gives us small gain comparing with the work needed to maintain/enhance. So I would like to obsolete parallel query in the future pgpool-II release.
