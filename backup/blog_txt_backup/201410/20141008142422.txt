在SR模式中, pgpool-II通过调用pg_is_in_recovery()函数来判断backend是primary还是standby.


How does pgpool-II find the primary node?

    pgpool-II issues "pg_SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()" to each DB node. If it returns true, then the node is a standby node. If one of DB nodes returns false, then the node is the primary node and done.
    Because it is possible that promoting node could return true for the SELECT, if no primary node is found and "search_primary_node_timeout" is greater than 0, pgpool-II sleeps 1 second and contines to issues the SELECT query to each DB node again until total sleep time exceeds search_primary_node_timeout.
