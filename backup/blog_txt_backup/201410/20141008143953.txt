Fix memory leak in pool_config.c

    The module in charge of parsing pgpool.conf has memory leak problem. Usually pgpool reads pgpool.conf just once at the start up time, it is not a big problem. However reloading pgpool.conf will leak memory and definitely a problem. Also using memory leak check tools like valgrind emit lots of error messages and
    very annoying. So it would be nice to fix the problem in the future.
