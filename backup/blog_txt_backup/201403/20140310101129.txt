红帽7将允许快速的块设备充当低速块设备的缓存. 太棒了啊.

Fast Block Devices Caching Slower Block Devices

The ability to have fast block devices act as a cache for slower block devices is introduced as a Technology Preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 Beta. This feature allows a PCIe SSD device to act as a cache for direct-attached storage (DAS) or storage area network (SAN) storage, which improves file system
performance.
