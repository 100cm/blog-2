Compiling psqlODBC on Unix

Following psqlODBC's move away from the main PostgreSQL source tree, Peter Eisentraut was kind enough provide a build environment for us which is now included in psqlODBC tarballs.

Installation

To install, just try something like:

    % tar -zxvf psqlodbc-xx.xx.xxxx.tar.gz
    % cd psqlodbc-xx.xx.xxxx
    % ./configure
    % make
    % make install

The configure script will accept the following useful options:

  • --with-libpq=DIR postgresql path(--without-libpq is not need libpq)
  • --with-unixodbc=DIR path or direct odbc_config file (default:yes)
  • --with-iodbc=DIR path or direct iodbc-config file
  • --with-odbcver=VERSION change default ODBC version number [0x0351]
  • --enable-pthreads (thread-safe driver on some platforms)
  • --disable-unicode (build non-Unicode driver)
  • --disable-openssl (build non-OpenSSL driver)
  • --help

Building a distribution

Prerequisites

  • Autoconf 2.59 or higher
  • Automake 1.9.2 (Lower versions are rejected, version 1.7 untested.)
  • Libtool 1.5.10 or higher
  • PostgreSQL source tree (8.4 branch)

Bootstrapping

    autoreconf -i

You can run 'make maintainer-clean' to remove all the files this generates.

Building

    ./configure
    make
    make install

configure has the same options that the PostgreSQL configure used to have for ODBC, namely --with-iodbc or --with-unixodbc

Making a Source Distribution

'make dist' makes a file psqlodbc-xx.xx.xxxx.tar.gz. It's even better to use 'make distcheck', which runs a number of tests to see if the distribution is internally consistent.

The distribution does not contain any Windows-specific files (*.def, maybe others). If it is desired to include them, edit Makefile.am.
