ABSTRACT
We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of B4, a private WAN connecting Google’s data centers across the planet. B4 has a number of unique characteristics: i) massive bandwidth requirements deployed to a modest number of sites, ii) elastic trafc demand that seeks to maximize average bandwidth, and iii)
full
control over the edge servers and network, which enables rate limiting and demand measurement at the edge.  ese characteristicsled to a So?ware De?ned Networking architecture using OpenFlow to
control relatively simple switches built from merchant silicon. B4’s
centralized tra?c engineering service drives links to near 100% utilization, while splitting application ?ows among multiple paths to
balance capacity against application priority/demands. We describe
experience with three years of B4 production deployment, lessons
learned, and areas for future work.
