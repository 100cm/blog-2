Trap
Asynchronous notification from agent to manager. SNMP traps enable an agent to notify the management station of significant events by way of an unsolicited SNMP message. Includes current sysUpTime value, an OID identifying the type of trap and optional variable bindings. Destination addressing for traps is determined
in an application-specific manner typically through trap configuration variables in the MIB. The format of the trap message was changed in SNMPv2 and the PDU was renamed SNMPv2-Trap. While in classic communication the client always actively requests information from the server, SNMP allows the additional use of
so-called "traps". These are data packages that are sent from the SNMP client to the server without being explicitly requested.
