PostgreSQL full access method and it's operator describe

2012-06-13 21:13:22   查看原文>>

附加的两个access method, btree_gist和btree_gin : 

digoal=# create extension btree_gist;
CREATE EXTENSION
digoal=# create extension btree_gin;
CREATE EXTENSION



新建一个获取类型的函数

digoal=> create or replace function get_type (i_oid oid) returns name as $$
declare
v_typname name;
begin
select typname into v_typname from pg_type where oid=i_oid;
return v_typname;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
CREATE FUNCTION



获得这些access method支持的操作符

digoal=> select amname,oprname,get_type(amoplefttype) as left,get_type(amoprighttype) as right,obj_description(pg_operator.oid) from pg_amop,pg_operator,pg_am where pg_operator.oid=pg_amop.amopopr  and pg_am.oid=pg_amop.amopmethod group by oprname,amname,obj_description(pg_operator.oid),get_type(amoplefttype),get_type(amoprighttype) order by amname,oprname,obj_description(pg_operator.oid);
