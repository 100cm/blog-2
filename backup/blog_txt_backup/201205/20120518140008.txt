PostgreSQL 9.2可以在数据库空闲的时候减少CPU的唤醒, 以达到节能的目的.
原文, 不做翻译.
Allow the bgwriter, walwriter, statistics collector, archiver, and checkpointer to sleep more efficiently during periods of inactivity (Peter Geoghegan, Heikki Linnakangas, Tom Lane)

This reduces CPU wake-ups, which dramatically reduces power consumption on idle servers.
