在虚拟机中C盘配置的空间太少了, 又不想用魔术分区这样的软件进行分区扩展.
于是想到了使用软链接的方法. 
这里要做的是将program files目录移到D盘, 然后做一个软连接.
首先将program files拷贝到D盘, 然后进入带命令行的安全模式, 将C盘下的program files删除. 
cd c:\
rd /s /q "Program Files"
如果有删除不干净的, 先卸载掉这些软件再rd.
例如security essential, cisco vpn软件
删除干净后
junction "c:\Program Files" "d:\Program Files"
好了.

junction的介绍以及使用方法 : 

Introduction

Windows 2000 and higher supports directory symbolic links, where a directory serves as a symbolic link to another directory on the computer. For example, if the directory D:\SYMLINK specified C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 as its target, then an application accessing D:\SYMLINK\DRIVERS would in reality be accessing C:\WINNT\
SYSTEM32\DRIVERS. Directory symbolic links are known as NTFS junctions in Windows. Unfortunately, Windows comes with no tools for creating junctions—you have to purchase the Win2K Resource Kit, which comes with the linkd program for creating junctions. I therefore decided to write my own junction-creating tool: 
Junction.Junction not only allows you to create NTFS junctions, it allows you to see if files or directories are actually reparse points. Reparse points are the mechanism on which NTFS junctions are based, and they are used by Windows' Remote Storage Service (RSS), as well as volume mount points.

Please read this Microsoft KB article for tips on using junctions.

Notethat Windows does not support junctions to directories on remote shares.

If you want to view reparse information, the usage for Junction is the following:

 

Using Junction

Use junction to list junctions:

Usage: [-s]

-s    Recurse subdirectories

Examples:

To determine if a file is a junction, specify the file name:

junction c:\test

To list junctions beneath a directory, include the –s switch:

junction -s c:\

To create a junction c:\Program-Files for "c:\Program Files":

C:\>md Program-Files

C:\>junction c:\Program-Files "c:\Program Files"

To delete a junction, use the –d switch:

junction -d c:\Program-Files
