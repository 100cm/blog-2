PostgreSQL copy to stdout or 'file' only select current table and not select child tables

使用COPY导出表时, 默认是不会导出子表的, 相当于select * from only table.

COPY only deals with the specific table named; it does not copy data to or from child tables. 
Thus for example COPY table TO shows the same data as SELECT * FROM ONLY table. 
But COPY (SELECT * FROM table) TO ... can be used to dump all of the data in an inheritance hierarchy.
