The easiest way to restore your data is to

1) Create a new database
2) install PostGIS 1.5  (the install files should bie in
share/contrib/postgis-1.5
3) Then restore your data on top
4) You'll should then get errors that the functions already exist and they
will be skipped.  You may get some errors too about the liblwgeom, but those
you can ignore (unless you are using them)
 since they represent functions long ago deprecated that got taken out of
postgis-1.5
