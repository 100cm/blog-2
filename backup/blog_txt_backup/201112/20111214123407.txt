Fix bugs in information_schema.referential_constraints view (Tom Lane)

This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key constraint. That could result in failure to show a foreign key constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it depends on a different constraint than the one it really
does.

Since the view definition is installed by initdb, merely upgrading will not fix the problem. If you need to fix this in an existing installation, you can (as a superuser) drop theinformation_schema schema then re-create it by sourcing SHAREDIR/information_schema.sql. (Run pg_config --sharedir if you're uncertain
where SHAREDIR is.) This must be repeated in each database to be fixed.


因此在修复时除了更新pgsql客户端，还需要将除template0之外的所有库的information_schema删掉，新建。

如

psql -h 127.0.0.1 template1 postgres -c "drop schema information_schema cascade"

psql -h 127.0.0.1 template1 postgres -f $PGHOME/share/information_schema.sql
