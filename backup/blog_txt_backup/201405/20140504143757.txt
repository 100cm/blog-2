Block dev with Partition Table: gpt cann't used to lvm

在给一台服务器创建pv的时候, 有些块设备正常, 但是有些块设备报这样的错.

# pvcreate /dev/sdb
  Physical volume "/dev/sdb" successfully created
# pvcreate /dev/sdc
  Device /dev/sdc not found (or ignored by filtering).


查看/etc/lvm/lvm.conf没有类似的过滤.

# grep filter /etc/lvm/lvm.conf
    # A filter that tells LVM2 to only use a restricted set of devices.
    # The filter consists of an array of regular expressions.  These
    # Don't have more than one filter line active at once: only one gets used.
    filter = [ "a/.*/" ]
    # filter = [ "r|/dev/cdrom|" ]
    # filter = [ "a/loop/", "r/.*/" ]
    # filter =[ "a|loop|", "r|/dev/hdc|", "a|/dev/ide|", "r|.*|" ]
    # filter = [ "a|^/dev/hda8$|", "r/.*/" ]
    # Since "filter" is often overridden from command line, it is not suitable
    # for system-wide device filtering (udev rules, lvmetad). To hide devices
    # global_filter. The syntax is the same as for normal "filter"
    # above. Devices that fail the global_filter are not even opened by LVM.
    # global_filter = []
    # The results of the filtering are cached on disk to avoid
    # mlock_filter = [ "locale/locale-archive", "gconv/gconv-modules.cache" ]


原因在这两个块设备的分区表上面, 因为lvm不支持gpt分区表, 所以无法创建PV.

清除分区表, 重新创建恢复正常.
