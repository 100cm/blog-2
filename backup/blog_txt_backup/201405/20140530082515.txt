GOsa? provides a powerful GPL'ed framework for managing accounts and systems in LDAP databases. Using GOsa? allows system administrators to easily manage users and groups, fat and thin clients, applications, phones and faxes, mail distribution lists and many other parameters. In conjunction with FAI (Fully Automatic
Installation), GOsa? allows the highly automated installation of preconfigured systems. GOsa? therefore provides a single, LDAP-based point of administration for large and small environments, thus making the administration of users and systems and all related parameters manageable and easy.

GOsa helps to integrate the new open source configuration. GOsa is well known in Germany, France, Belgium, Spain and much more countries in Europe and also in USA. This web site is to gather all those people who have interest in GOsa and to share in different language informations about this product.
