PostgreSQL 9.5 new feature - Add support for INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE

2015-05-10 21:48:20   查看原文>>

PostgreSQL 9.5 将新增大多数MySQL用户喜欢的一个功能，存在则更新，不存在则插入的SQL原子操作。
实际上PostgreSQL对这个功能进行了增强，可以做得更强。
具体用法可以去参考文档：
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/sql-insert.html
EXCLUDED.xxx 表示将要插入的冲突列，. xxx表示已经存在的冲突列。
例子：

  INSERT INTO distributors (did, dname)
  VALUES (5, 'Gizmo transglobal'), (6, 'Associated Computing, inc')
  ON CONFLICT (did) DO UPDATE SET dname = EXCLUDED.dname;

  INSERT INTO distributors (did, dname) VALUES (7, 'Redline GmbH')
  ON CONFLICT (did) DO NOTHING;

  -- Don't update existing distributors based in a certain ZIP code
  INSERT INTO distributors AS d (did, dname) VALUES (8, 'Anvil Distribution')
  ON CONFLICT (did) DO UPDATE
  SET dname = EXCLUDED.dname || ' (formerly ' || d.dname || ')'
  WHERE d.zipcode != '21201';

  -- Name a constraint directly in the statement (uses associated
  -- index to arbitrate taking the DO NOTHING action)
  INSERT INTO distributors (did, dname) VALUES (9, 'Antwerp Design')
  ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT distributors_pkey DO NOTHING;

  -- This statement could infer a partial unique index on "did"
  -- with a predicate of "WHERE is_active", but it could also
  -- just use a regular unique constraint on "did"
  INSERT INTO distributors (did, dname) VALUES (10, 'Conrad International')
  ON CONFLICT (did) WHERE is_active DO NOTHING;



Add support for INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE.

Add support for INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE.

The newly added ON CONFLICT clause allows to specify an alternative to
raising a unique or exclusion constraint violation error when inserting.
ON CONFLICT refers to constraints that can either be specified using a
inference clause (by specifying the columns of a unique constraint) or
by naming a unique or exclusion constraint.  DO NOTHING avoids the
constraint violation, without touching the pre-existing row.  DO UPDATE
SET ... [WHERE ...] updates the pre-existing tuple, and has access to
both the tuple proposed for insertion and the existing tuple; the
optional WHERE clause can be used to prevent an update from being
executed.  The UPDATE SET and WHERE clauses have access to the tuple
proposed for insertion using the "magic" EXCLUDED alias, and to the
pre-existing tuple using the table name or its alias.

This feature is often referred to as upsert.

This is implemented using a new infrastructure called "speculative
insertion". It is an optimistic variant of regular insertion that first
does a pre-check for existing tuples and then attempts an insert.  If a
violating tuple was inserted concurrently, the speculatively inserted
tuple is deleted and a new attempt is made.  If the pre-check finds a
matching tuple the alternative DO NOTHING or DO UPDATE action is taken.
If the insertion succeeds without detecting a conflict, the tuple is
deemed inserted.

To handle the possible ambiguity between the excluded alias and a table
named excluded, and for convenience with long relation names, INSERT
INTO now can alias its target table.

Bumps catversion as stored rules change.
