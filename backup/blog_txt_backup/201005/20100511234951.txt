PostgreSQL Vaccum 的几种模式比较

VACUUM是PostgreSQL提供的垃圾回收的SQL命令。

9.0的语法如下:

VACUUM [ ( { FULL | FREEZE | VERBOSE | ANALYZE } [, ...] ) ] [ table [ (column [, ...] ) ] ]VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] [ table ]VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] ANALYZE [ table [ (column [, ...] ) ] ]

8.3的语法如下：

VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] [ table ]VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] ANALYZE [ table [ (column [, ...] ) ] ]

光从语法上看的话，差别并不是很大.

这里的话主要说说两个版本的差别，功能性的细节和注意事项就不说了。

9.0的vacuum full可以回收INDEX的PAGES，而8。3是不可以的，下面看一个例子；

9.0：

创建测试表

create table tbl_test1 (id serial8 primary key,pid int8);

插入测试数据

test=> insert into tbl_test1 (pid) select generate_series(333333,100000000000);

中途退出

Cancel request sent

ERROR:  canceling statement due to user request

回收垃圾

test=> vacuum verbose tbl_test1;INFO: vacuuming "test.tbl_test1"INFO: scanned index "tbl_test1_pkey" to remove 3358129 row versionsDETAIL: CPU 0.01s/1.18u sec elapsed 1.32 sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": removed 3358129 row versions in 18153 pagesDETAIL: CPU 0.07s/0.19u sec elapsed 0.50 sec.INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now

再来一次

test=> vacuum verbose tbl_test1;INFO: vacuuming "test.tbl_test1"INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 11259 pagesDETAIL: 0 index row versions were removed.11255 index pages have been deleted, 11255 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/0.02u sec elapsed 0.02 sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0 removable, 0
nonremovable row versions in 0 out of 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.There were 0 unused item pointers.0 pages are entirely empty.CPU 0.00s/0.02u sec elapsed 0.02 sec.VACUUM

可以看出VACUUM 不回收索引的空闲页面。

test=> vacuum full verbose tbl_test1;INFO: vacuuming "test.tbl_test1"VACUUMtest=> vacuum verbose tbl_test1;INFO: vacuuming "test.tbl_test1"INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 1 pagesDETAIL: 0 index row versions were removed.0 index pages have been deleted, 0 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/
0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0 removable, 0 nonremovable row versions in 0 out of 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.There were 0 unused item pointers.0 pages are entirely empty.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.VACUUM

从VACUUM FULL可以看出。9.0已经将索引的空闲空间回收了。

8.3例：

postgres=# vacuum verbose tbl_Test1;INFO: vacuuming "public.tbl_test1"INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 1033 pagesDETAIL: 0 index row versions were removed.1029 index pages have been deleted, 1029 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0
removable, 0 nonremovable row versions in 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.There were 0 unused item pointers.0 pages contain useful free space.0 pages are entirely empty.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.VACUUMpostgres=# vacuum verbose tbl_Test1;INFO: vacuuming "public.tbl_test1"INFO: index
"tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 1033 pagesDETAIL: 0 index row versions were removed.1029 index pages have been deleted, 1029 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0 removable, 0 nonremovable row versions in 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be
removed yet.There were 0 unused item pointers.0 pages contain useful free space.0 pages are entirely empty.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.VACUUM

VACUUM的功能和9.0一样，只是输出的信息比9.0少。再看看VACUUM FULL

postgres=# vacuum full verbose tbl_Test1;INFO: vacuuming "public.tbl_test1"INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0 removable, 0 nonremovable row versions in 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.Nonremovable row versions range from 0 to 0 bytes long.There were 0 unused item pointers.Total free space (including
removable row versions) is 0 bytes.0 pages are or will become empty, including 0 at the end of the table.0 pages containing 0 free bytes are potential move destinations.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 1033 pagesDETAIL: 1029 index pages have been deleted,
1029 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.VACUUM

postgres=# vacuum verbose tbl_Test1;INFO: vacuuming "public.tbl_test1"INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 1033 pagesDETAIL: 0 index row versions were removed.1029 index pages have been deleted, 1029 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0
removable, 0 nonremovable row versions in 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.There were 0 unused item pointers.0 pages contain useful free space.0 pages are entirely empty.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.VACUUM

可以看出8.3的VACUUM并没有回收索引空闲空间

8.3在TRUNCATE后

postgres=# truncate table tbl_Test1;TRUNCATE TABLEpostgres=# vacuum verbose tbl_Test1;INFO: vacuuming "public.tbl_test1"INFO: index "tbl_test1_pkey" now contains 0 row versions in 1 pagesDETAIL: 0 index row versions were removed.0 index pages have been deleted, 0 are currently reusable.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00
sec.INFO: "tbl_test1": found 0 removable, 0 nonremovable row versions in 0 pagesDETAIL: 0 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.There were 0 unused item pointers.0 pages contain useful free space.0 pages are entirely empty.CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.VACUUM
